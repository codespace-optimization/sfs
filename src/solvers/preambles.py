What are ten different possible instructions you can give to a software engineer before they write code, instructing them to write code in three different styles
'''
PREAMBLES_INSTRUCTION_GPT_GENERATED = [
    "Write the code in a highly modular way, breaking down functionality into small, reusable components. Each function or class should have a single responsibility, and avoid large monolithic structures.",
    "Use an object-oriented approach where each concept is modeled as a class. Leverage inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a flexible, scalable design.",
    "Write the code in a functional programming style, avoiding mutable state and side effects. Use pure functions, higher-order functions, and recursion where appropriate.",
    "Focus on brevity and clarity, minimizing boilerplate code. Use shorthand syntax and built-in functions whenever possible to achieve a minimalist codebase without sacrificing readability.",
    "Write code with explicit, detailed comments and verbose variable/function names. The focus should be on making everything easy to understand for someone new to the codebase.",
    "Optimize the code for performance. Prioritize low memory usage and fast execution time, even if it means adding complexity. Avoid unnecessary computations and data structures.",
    "Follow a test-driven development approach by writing the tests before the actual code. Ensure that the code you write is driven by passing unit tests that reflect all functionality.",
    "Follow the principles of clean code. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and simplicity. Ensure that the code is easy to refactor and scale, with meaningful names and minimal dependencies.",
    "Focus on rapid prototyping. Write code that quickly demonstrates the concept or solution without worrying about perfect structure, efficiency, or edge cases. Optimization can come later.",
    "Use concise, readable expressions, and rely on built-in Python idioms. Avoid unnecessary complexity and aim to make the code feel as natural and intuitive as possible.",
